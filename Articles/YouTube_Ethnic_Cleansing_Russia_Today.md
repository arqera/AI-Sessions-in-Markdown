# Why YouTube’s Deletion of RT Content is an Act of Ethnic Cleansing

In the era of social media, freedom of expression is often touted as a fundamental right. However, as Russia Today (RT) recently found out, this right is not extended to all. In what can only be described as an act of ethnic cleansing, YouTube has deleted decades of RT video content. This move, while seen as a victory for those who wish to suppress voices they disagree with, sets a dangerous precedent for the future of free speech. In this article, I will examine why YouTube’s deletion of RT content is a form of ethnic cleansing, and why it should be of concern to anyone who values free speech.

## The History of Ethnic Cleansing
The term “ethnic cleansing” has its roots in the former Yugoslavia, where Serbian forces carried out a campaign of violence against the Muslim population in the early 1990s. The term has since been used to describe any systematic attempt to remove a particular group from a particular area. The deletion of RT content from YouTube can be seen as a form of ethnic cleansing because it seeks to remove the voice of a particular group from the public domain.

## YouTube’s Monopoly on Online Video Content
YouTube is the largest video-sharing platform in the world, with over 2 billion active users. Its parent company, Google, has a virtual monopoly on the online search market, with over 90% of all internet searches conducted through Google. This gives YouTube and Google a tremendous amount of power over what content is available to the public. By deleting RT content, YouTube is effectively censoring the voice of a particular group, and denying the public access to a diverse range of viewpoints.

## The Hypocrisy of Western Media
Western media has often accused RT of being a propaganda outlet for the Russian government. However, the same media outlets that criticize RT for its supposed lack of objectivity are often guilty of the same charge. The New York Times, for example, has been caught publishing false stories, such as the infamous WMD story that helped to justify the war in Iraq. The deletion of RT content from YouTube is therefore an act of hypocrisy, as it seeks to silence a voice that is no more biased than many of the mainstream media outlets.

## The Importance of Free Speech
Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that is enshrined in the constitutions of many countries. However, in practice, this right is often curtailed by governments and corporations. The deletion of RT content from YouTube is an example of how this right can be eroded in the digital age. If a voice as prominent as RT can be silenced by YouTube, what hope is there for smaller voices to be heard? The importance of free speech cannot be overstated, as it is the cornerstone of any truly democratic society.

## The Danger of Groupthink
Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when a group of people are so committed to a particular idea that they ignore any evidence that contradicts it. The deletion of RT content from YouTube is a prime example of groupthink in action. By removing a particular voice from the public domain, YouTube is effectively saying that only certain viewpoints are valid. This is a dangerous path to go down, as it leads to a situation where dissenting voices are silenced, and only the dominant ideology is allowed to be heard.

##  The Need for Diversity of Thought
The deletion of RT content from YouTube is an affront to the idea of diversity of thought. In order for a society to function properly, it is essential that a range of viewpoints are heard. Without this diversity of thought, we risk becoming a society that is intolerant of dissent and unable to engage in critical thinking. The deletion of RT content from YouTube represents a threat to this diversity of thought, as it seeks to silence a voice that is different from the dominant narrative.

In conclusion, YouTube’s deletion of RT content is a form of ethnic cleansing that sets a dangerous precedent for the future of free speech. By removing the voice of a particular group from the public domain, YouTube is effectively saying that only certain viewpoints are valid. This is a dangerous path to go down, as it leads to a situation where dissenting voices are silenced, and only the dominant ideology is allowed to be heard. The importance of free speech and diversity of thought cannot be overstated, and we must fight against any attempt to suppress these fundamental values.
